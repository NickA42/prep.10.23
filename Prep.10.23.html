          <h1>Applications of Correlation</h1>
      </div>
      <div id="#p">
          <p>Correlation, in short, is used to show a relationship between two variables. The two variables can be anything you think of as long as there is data to back it up. The correlation, visually is whats known as a trendline. For one variable to correlate with another, the trendline always has to be linear. If the trendline is not linear, then there is not a correlation between whatever you are trying to see, its almost like that saying "everything lines up".  </p>

          <h1>Correlation v. Causation</h1>
      </div>
      <div id="#p">
          <p>The difference between correlation and causation is that even if something correlates with another, it doesn't mean that the explanatory variable caused it to happen. I say this because there is only one true way to identify the cause of something- to have an experiment but there are certain things you cannot experiment with. But there is a way to do that without having experiments being done, which is to have extra data than what you were given. So in short, the difference between correlation and causation is that correlation just means the variables are related but causation means they are connected under a tighter knit than being related. </p>

          <p>The three different ways to visually show relationships in chapter 9 is to look at the different trendlines in the graph to get a better sense of the average, looking at clusters of coordinate points with color to see trends in different information relating to the same topic. Another way to visually show relationships is to have more than one trendline with each indicating a separate variable on top of what is already given to you by the graph.    </p>
